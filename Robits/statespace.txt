Useful metrics for state space:

	Define a min distance value where if something important is in the distance, then we take note of it.

		-distance from robot_i to other robot_j
		-angle between i and j
	

		-distance to a wall.
	If there is nothing in that circle of interest, then we create a "blank" state.
